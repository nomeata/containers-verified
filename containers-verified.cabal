name:                containers-verified
version:             0.5.11.0
synopsis:            Formally verified drop-in replacement of containers
description:
  In the context of the <https://deepspec.org/main DeepSpec project>, parts of the
  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/containers containers> library were
  formally verified using <https://github.com/antalsz/hs-to-coq hs-to-coq> and
  the interactive theorem prover Coq.
  .
  This package depends on precisely the verified version of containers and
  re-exports the verified parts of the API, with module name and function name
  unchanged.
  .
  If you happen to use only the verified subset of the API, then you can simply change
  @containers@ to @containers-verified@ in your @.cabal@ file and earn bragging
  rights about using verified data structures in your project. Because the
  types from @containers@ are re-exported, you can still interface with other
  libraries that depend on @containers@ directly.
  .
  If you happen to need additional modules or functions, you will have to
  depend on both @containers@ and @containers-verified@, and use
  <https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/glasgow_exts.html#package-qualified-imports package-qualified imports> to disambiguate.
  .
  This module does not re-export any of the @â€¦.Internals@ modules.
  .
  We cannot control which type class instances are re-exported; these therefore
  may give you access to unverified code. Also, the @conatiners@ code contains
  some CPP directives; these can enable different code on your machine than the
  code that we verified (e.g. different bit-widths).
  .
  To learn more about what exactly has been verified, and how wide the
  formalization gap is, read our paper (which we are currenty writing).
  .
  The long-term maintenance plan for this package is not fleshed out yet, and
  certainly depends on user-demand. Let us know your needs! (And your abilities
  to contribute...)
